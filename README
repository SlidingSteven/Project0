Description
This program needs the user to give a range and a file i.e. ./project0 range < filename.txt
Replace range with one of three options 
    1 Nothing will give an automatic range of all chars
    2 By passing a single char you will be choosing a range of that char until the last char in the list of ASCII chars
    3 By passing two chars i.e. "a z" you are giving it a range of a to z.
This will output the range followed by a list of the chars in the range and the number of times they were used in the file you passed.

I also used what material from canvas for the makefile and changed it to have my project name.
